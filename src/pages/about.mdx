## Howdy.

My name is Varun and I'm a developer living in Chennai. I build Norton browser extensions at [Symantec Corp](https://symantec.com/)!

Before I joined Symantec, I used to work and develop Python applications but now I work primarily in JavaScript and React.

I have always been fascinated by open web and open source and hence try to give back as much as I can. I have a really strong opinion on privacy and I usually get pissed off seeing data being misused.

In my free time, I enjoy playing FIFA, reading books and listening podcasts.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AsDeyQuote), [Github](https://github.com/varundey), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/varundey), or reach me via [email](mailto:varundey20@gmail.com). I promise I won't bite. :)
