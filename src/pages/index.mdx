Hi, I am Varun. I build things that help users have a better experience on web.

Currently working as a Software Engineer at [Grofers](https://lambda.grofers.com/) as part of their supply chain engineering.

My past gig was at [NortonLifeLock](https://www.nortonlifelock.com/) (formerly [Symantec](https://www.symantec.com)) where I worked with Browser Protection team to help build products for millions of our users.

I enjoy watching football (Visca El Bar√ßa) and reading in my free time. Check out my [readlist](https://www.goodreads.com/varundey).

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AsDeyQuote), [Github](https://github.com/varundey), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/varundey), or reach me via [email](mailto:varundey20@gmail.com). I promise I won't bite. :)
