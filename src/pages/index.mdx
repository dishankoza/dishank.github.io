Hi, I am Dishank. I’m passionate about System Architecture and implementing innovative solutions that enhance software. 

Currently I am pursuing masters in Computer Science at [Santa Clara University](https://www.scu.edu/).

Previously, I worked as a Senior SDE at [Freespace](https://www.afreespace.com/), where I refactored intricate systems, optimized performance, and led successful projects in a fast-paced environment.

I enjoy YouTube videos on how things work, especially "An Element of Truth," which covers science, education, and other captivating topics.

My current favorites are [Asli Engineering](https://www.youtube.com/@AsliEngineering) and [Veritasium](https://www.youtube.com/@veritasium).

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dishank-oza-169662164/), [Github](https://github.com/dishankoza) or reach me via [email](mailto:dishankoza@outlook.com).
