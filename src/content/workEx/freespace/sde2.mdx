**As a Senior SDE, I have refactored and rearchitected several tightly coupled features into scalable and independent services.
Here are some key highlights of my work:**
- **Backend Architecture Refactoring:** Redesigned the backend architecture by implementing a worker with AWS Lambda for batch processing, integrating Step Function events, AWS DMS, and AWS Kinesis. This effort led to a 3000% reduction in event creation.
- **Infrastructure Optimization:** Addressed infrastructure-level API transaction issues by implementing Redis distributed locks and transitioning to an event-driven system. This resulted in a 57% improvement in system performance and user experience.
- **Team Leadership and Agile Methodologies:** Led a team of 6 people, actively participating in agile development methodologies, including Scrum, to ensure efficient project management and on-time delivery of features.

**Skills learned:**
- Cloud Services: AWS Lambda, Step Functions, DMS, Kinesis, CloudFormation
- Backend Development: Microservices architecture, Spring Boot, GraphQL
- Performance Optimization: Redis distributed locks, event-driven systems, PWA features, caching strategies
- Agile Practices: Scrum, team leadership, project management

**Certifications and Awards:**
- AWS Certified Developer â€“ Associate
- Awarded as Freespace Captain for successfully leading the team, utilizing exceptional problem-solving skills, and ensuring timely delivery of project deliverables
