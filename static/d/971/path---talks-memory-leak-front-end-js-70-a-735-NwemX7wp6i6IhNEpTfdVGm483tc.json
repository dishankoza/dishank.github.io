I am talking about PySangamam 2018 - the very first Tamil Nadu’s Python conference. I have earlier given casual talks in monthly local meetups and took sessions at office but this was my first time at a stage this big and in an official conference. Needless to say I was nervous. The talks were selected through the CFP process - which was same as any other conference talk selection process and I really did not think that my talk would be selected and put up on the conference schedule. I submmitted my talk for a very general concept of programming - Tail Call recursion. I tailored it to fit around Python and how Python handles Tail call recursion. To give a bit more explainining to it, I also added stack frames to it and hence the tilte of my talk became - “Stack Frames and Tail Call Recursion in Python”.`), React.createElement(MDXTag, {\n      name: \"p\",\n      components: components\n    }, `Here is the video if you are interested:\n`, React.createElement(MDXTag, {\n      name: \"a\",\n      components: components,\n      parentName: \"p\",\n      props: {\n        \"href\": \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrY3ZimMxLo\"\n      }\n    }, React.createElement(MDXTag, {\n      name: \"img\",\n      components: components,\n      parentName: \"a\",\n      props: {\n        \"src\": \"https://img.youtube.com/vi/lrY3ZimMxLo/0.jpg\",\n        \"alt\": \"Stack Frames and Tail Call Recursion in Python\"\n      }\n    }))), React.createElement(MDXTag, {\n      name: \"p\",\n      components: components\n    }, `Feedback/comments are always welcome! :)`));\n  }\n\n}\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/talks/memory-leak-front-end-js/"}}
